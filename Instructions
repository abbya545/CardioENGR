About the Data:
The data files in this repository contain synchronous recordings of apexcardiogram (ACG) and electrocardiogram (ECG). The recording procedure document is also included in the folder. Each data file contains multiple trials which are split into separate arrays. For easy plotting in MatLab, use “ACG_ECG_Plot.m” provided in the main GitHub folder. This file will automatically plot each trial in the file in a separate graph. To use the progam, download the data files to your MatLab folder path, clear all variables from the MatLab workspace, double click on the data file name to load it into the workspace, the run the script and enjoy the conveniently plotted signals.
